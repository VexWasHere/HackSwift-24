# Hackathon info (HackSwift 2024)

Dear Hackathon Organizers,

I hope this message finds you well. I would like to apologize for not submitting my video for the hackathon. Unfortunately, I had technical issues while trying to participate in the event.

As a student using a school-provided Chromebook, I had problems accessing certain tools and platforms. One thing I wasn't able to view was the Discord server, which made it hard to figure out information about the competition.

Although it says to submit a video, I wasn't able to. I understand the importance of deadlines and respect the rules established for the hackathon. I hope you accept my apology for any inconvenience caused.

If there is any possibility of providing alternative means for me to submit my work, I would really appreciate it. I am passionate about working in the hackathon, and I am hoping to fix the situation if allowed to.

Thank you for understanding, and I hope you respond.

Sincerely,

-Charles Harper, (Team __RIOT__)
